Socioeconomic and Structural Determinants of Voter Turnout in U.S. Elections (1980–2025)

This project examines how socioeconomic and cultural factors influence voter turnout in the United States. The goal is to understand whether shifts in cost of living, income, crime, weather, or other social conditions are associated with higher or lower electoral participation over time. Focus: The analysis will include country-level, state-level, and city-level elections across several key states. We're looking at voter turnout across six states with different political leanings: New York and California (consistently Democratic), Ohio and Michigan (swing states), and Florida and Utah (consistently Republican).
